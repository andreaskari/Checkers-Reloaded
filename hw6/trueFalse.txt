1 F lower bound is bounded by constant * log(N)
2 T BSTs are optimized to work in log(N) on average
3 F lower bound is bounded by constant * log(N)
4 T Worst case is a spindle tree with N runtime.
5 T Worst case has N runtime which is less than N^2.
6 T The average number of comparisons is log(N) for both processes.
7 F Best case runtime is big-Omega(1)
8 O(1) z is almost always greater than 1
