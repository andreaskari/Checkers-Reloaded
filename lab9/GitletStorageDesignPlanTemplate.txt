Basic Storage Design Plan for Gitlet


Overview
-------

stagePlatform.ser: contains the list of staged files (viewable with status command).
commitHistory.ser: contains the history of commits (viewable with log command).


Sequential Example
-------

For each of the commands below, describe in detail what files on your computer change after the command is executed. Only list changes made to files. Do not list details regarding the reading of files.

$ java Gitlet init

 . If it does not already exist, a new folder called .gitlet is created in the current directory.
 . The commitHistory.ser file is created with an initial commit.
 . The empty stagePlatform.ser file is created.


$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

 . Adds dog.txt to the stage for the next commit.
 . stagePlatform.ser file is overriden with new stage.


$ java Gitlet commit “initial commit of dog.txt”

 . Creates a commit with dog.txt (which is on the stage).
 . log now contains Commit 1 with message “initial commit of dog.txt”.
 . commitHistory.ser file is overriden with new commit.
 . stagePlatform.ser file is overriden with empty stage.


$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

 . Returns a message that exclaims that the File has not been modified since last commit.
 . dog.txt is not staged.
 . stagePlatform.ser is unchanged.


$ cp manyDogs.txt dog.txt
$ java Gitlet add dog.txt

 . dog.txt has changes made to it (making it elegiible for staging).
 . Adds dog.txt to the stage for the next commit.
 . stagePlatform.ser file is overriden with new stage.


$ java Gitlet commit “replaced dog.txt with manyDogs”

 . Commits the changes that have been made to dog.txt.
 . log now contains Commit 2 with message “replaced dog.txt with manyDogs”.
 . commitHistory.ser file is overriden with new commit.
 . stagePlatform.ser file is overriden with empty stage.


$ java Gitlet add manyDogs.txt

 . Adds manyDogs.txt to the stage.
 . stagePlatform.ser file is overriden with new stage.


$ java Gitlet add ketchupFriend.txt

 . Adds ketchupFriend.txt to the stage.

$ java Gitlet commit “added manyDogs and ketchupFriend”

 . log now contains Commit 3 with message “added manyDogs and ketchupFriend”.
 . commitHistory.ser file is overriden with new commit.
 . stagePlatform.ser file is overriden with empty stage.


$ java Gitlet commit YOLO

 . Returns a message that exclaims that no changes have been added to the commit.
 . Does not create or store a commit.
 . commitHistory.ser file is unchanged.
 

$ cp doge.txt manyDogs.txt
$ java Gitlet add manyDogs.txt

 . manyDogs.txt has changes made to it (making it elegiible for staging).
