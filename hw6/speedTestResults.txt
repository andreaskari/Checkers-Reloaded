The BSTMap and TreeMap were much much faster when handling large numbers of Strings compared to ULLMap. ULLMap overflowed in some cases while BSTMap and TreeMap didn't.

Even when inserting in order, BSTMap and TreeMap are much faster than ULLMap but are generally slower compared to when Strings are inputted randomly.
